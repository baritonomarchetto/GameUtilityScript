# Game Utility Script
Game Utility Script (GUS) is a hidden frontend for MAME cabinets. 
If your gamelist is small, there's no need for a full frontend and this could be the right solution for you.
GUS not only cycle between games in your list at the press of a key (or joystick button), but also shuts your PC down (another button, yes).

Supported emulators: MAME.

I wrote this simple autoit script for a friend's genuine Buggy Boy cabinet I converted. Take a look at the following link if you are interested ;)
